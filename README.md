# PDO_IBM

Interface for PHP to DB2 for z/OS, DB2 for LUW, DB2 for i.

## Pre-requisites

Install PHP 7.4 and above. The minimum PHP version supported by driver is PHP 7.4 and the latest version supported is PHP 8.1.

## IBM i users

When running on IBM i, `PDO_IBM` doesn't link with the Db2 LUW client library,
but instead with libdb400, which provides a PASE wrapper for SQL/CLI. The
differences between SQL/CLI in IBM i and the LUW driver are wrapped for you.
You don't need Db2 Connect on IBM i as a result.

To install, make sure you have the new Yum-based OSS environment. Install PHP,
plus any dependencies like so:

```shell
yum install sqlcli-devel gcc make-gnu
```

Tony Cairns' [replacement libdb400](https://bitbucket.org/litmis/db2sock/src/master/db2/)
is not yet tested, but may be desirable due to its greater debugging features.

IBM i users should read `tests/README400.txt` in order to set up prequisites
for unit tests.

## LUW/z/Db2 Connect users

CLIDRIVER should be installed in your system.
If not installed Download from the below link.

PHP should be installed in your system.

## How to install php pdo_ibm extension in Linux/Mac
```
if IBM_DB_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable not set then set them with installed CLIDRIVER.
(say CLIDRIVER installed at "/home/user/clidriver")

export IBM_DB_HOME=/home/user/clidriver 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/clidriver/lib

1) pecl install pdo_ibm
        
2) Open the php.ini file in an editor of your choice. Edit the extension entry in the
   php.ini file in the <local_php_directory>/php/lib directory to reference the PHP driver:
       extension=pdo_ibm.so
       
3) Ensure that the PHP driver can access the libdb2.so CLI driver file by
   setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for Linux and UNIX operating systems
   other than the AIXÂ® operating system. For AIX operating system, you must set LIBPATH variable. 

4) Optional: If the PHP application that is connecting to an IBM database server is running ini
   the HTTP server environment, add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in the httpd.conf file.

```
## Prebuilt binaries for Windows

1. Add the `CLIDRIVER\bin` path to the `PATH` environment variable like so (for a batch file):
    ```
    set PATH=<CLIDRIVER installed path>\bin;%PATH%
    ```
2. Download the DLLs for PHP 7.x and 8.x from [the ibmdb repository](https://github.com/ibmdb/php_ibm_db2).
   Select the build for the PHP that matches the version, architecture, and thread model.

3. Open the `php.ini` file in an editor of your choice. Edit the extension entry in the
   `php.ini` file in the `<local_php_directory>\php\lib` directory to reference the driver:
    ````
    extension=php_pdo_ibm
    ````

## How to run sample program

### connect.php:-

```
<?php
        $db = null;
        $dsn = "ibm:<DSN NAME>";
        $user = "<USER>";
        $pass = "<PASSWORD>";

        $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
        if ($pdo)
           print "Connection Successful.\n";

?>


To run the sample:- php connect.php
```
